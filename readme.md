# IGNIS

**Intervention Graded Nullifying Incendiary System**  
A field-deployable hazard neutralization apparatus, implemented as a real-life, modular bomb puzzle game.

IGNIS is inspired by *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* but uses a **physical bomb puzzle** featuring **swappable riddle modules**.  

Also known as _Kinetic Threat Anomaly Neutralization Equipment_.

## Project Overview

IGNIS is a modular hardware–software puzzle ecosystem consisting of:
- One central **hub** device
- Multiple interchangeable **riddle modules**
- Well-defined mechanical, electrical and communication interfaces

The project is designed with **modularity, replayability and extensibility** in mind.

## Where to Start

If you are new to the project:

0. Read `documentation/readme.md` to understand the documentation structure of the project
1. Read `documentation/architecture.md` to understand the conceptual architecture of the IGNIS ecosystem -> *"what"*
2. Read `documentation/assembly.md` for instructions on how to build/assemble IGNIS devices from release artifacts. -> *"how to assemble"*
3. Read `documentation/workflow.md` to understand how the repository is structured -> *"how to develop"*
4. Explore `specifications/` for in depth details 

## Features
- Physical, real-life modular puzzle bomb
- Swappable riddle modules
- Electronics, firmware, and mechanical domains
- 3D-printed and PCB-based components
- TVA-inspired retro-industrial aesthetic
- Designed for replayability through randomized environment parameters

## Disclaimer

IGNIS contains no explosive or hazardous materials and is purely a puzzle device.
